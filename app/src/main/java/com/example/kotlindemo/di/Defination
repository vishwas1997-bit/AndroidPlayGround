@Module : This is used on the class that does the work of constructing objects that’ll be eventually
provided as dependencies.
@Provides : This is used on the methods inside the Module class that’ll return the object.
@Inject : This is used upon a constructor, field or a method and indicates that dependency has been requested.
@Component : The Module class doesn’t provide the dependency directly to the class that’s requesting it.
 For this, a Component interface is used that acts as a bridge between @Module and @Inject.
@Singleton : This indicates that only a single instance of the dependency object would be created.
